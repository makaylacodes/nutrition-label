# nutrition-label

This is a learning-based project written in CSS. 

Typography is the art of styling text to be easily read. In CSS, it includes the concepts of styling text, adjusting line height, and positioning text.

To learn these concepts, I created a nutrition label. The project is hosted <a href="https://nutrition-label-css.netlify.app/">HERE</a>
